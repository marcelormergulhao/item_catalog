# Item Catalog App

This project is a simple sports catalog, containing several sports as categories and the respective items inside them.

This is part of Udacity's Fullstack Developer Nanodegree.

# How to run it

First, install all the dependencies to run the app:

`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

Then you should populate the database with the some items to enable item visualization. To do that simply run the "populte_database" script:

`python3 populate_database.py`

After that you should have a proper database with several items and categories and one user.

The user is named "test" and the password for this user is "pass". If you want to edit or delete the current loaded items you should login with the test user.

If you want to add a new user and enable item edition go to the "Register User" page or the "Login" page and login with your Google Account.

To run the flask app you should run it with the "run.py" script provided:

`python3 run.py`

Finally, to see the page, just use your browser and go to "http://localhost:5000/catalog".
